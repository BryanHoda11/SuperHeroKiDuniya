# About SuperHeroKiDuniya

```
1. I fetched Movies, Games and Series data about Superheroes from OMDb API and displayed it in my web-app.
```

```
2. In the Home page I displayed all data. But in Popular.jsx I populated the page with only limited data which are "most popular".
```

```
3. I added the functionality to add your favourite movie / game to 'My List', so to do that I made use of Context API for state management and conditionally rendered the favourite movies that the user will add.
```

```
4. The favourites added and displayed in My List is safely saved in the Local Storage along with the count that displays the number of movies saved. 
```

```
5. Thouroughly enjoyed this project as I strenghtened my skills in API integration! ðŸ’–
